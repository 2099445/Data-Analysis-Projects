## Heart Disease Analysis

This project involves analyzing the Heart Disease UCI dataset to explore patterns and insights related to heart disease.

### Dataset
- **Name**: Heart Disease UCI Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about patients' health indicators and is used to predict the presence of heart disease.

### Overview
The Heart Disease UCI dataset contains 13 variables related to demographic, medical, and exercise-related factors that help predict heart disease. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we examined the distribution and relationships of key variables such as age, cholesterol, and chest pain type. Older age, higher cholesterol, and certain types of chest pain (typical angina) were found to significantly increase heart disease risk. We also looked at exercise-induced angina and maximum heart rate, which further supported the risk predictions. Various machine learning models were applied, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The Random Forest model emerged as the most accurate, achieving the best performance metrics, making it the most suitable choice for predicting heart disease based on this dataset.
