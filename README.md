The Heart Disease UCI dataset contains 13 variables related to demographic, medical, and exercise-related factors that help predict heart disease. Through Exploratory Data Analysis , the distribution and relationships of key variables such as age, cholesterol, and chest pain type were examined. Older age, higher cholesterol, and certain types of chest pain (typical angina) were found to significantly increase heart disease risk. Exercise-induced angina and maximum heart rate, which further supported the risk predictions. Various machine learning models were applied, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The Random Forest model emerged as the most accurate, achieving the best performance metrics, making it the most suitable choice for predicting heart disease based on this dataset.
